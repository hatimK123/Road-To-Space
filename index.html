    <h2>What Is Space?</h2>
</div>

<div class="introans">
    <p>Space holds many secrets. It contains places where human beings can be stretched into spaghetti shapes,<br> or boiled, or frozen solid: that's why astronauts wear protetcting clothing in space.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="listintroque">
<p>When people think of space, they think of:</p>
</div>
<div class="listintroans">
    <p>1) Silence - there is no air in space, so there is absolutely no sound.</p>
    <p>2) Rockets and Satelites - are what scientists use to explore space.</p>
    <p>3) Astronauts - people who explorethe world beyond our earth.</p>
    <p>4) Stars - every star is a burning ball of gas. Our Sun is a star.</p>
    <p>5) Weightlessness - everything floats as if there's no gravity.</p>

    <h2>Is That Space?</h2>
</div>
<div class="isthatspaceans">
    <p>On a cloudless night, you can see thousands of stars. Space is the name we give to the huge empty areas in<br>between the atmospheres of stars and planets.Apart from the odd rock, space is sprinkled only with dust and gas.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="whyisspacedarkque">
    <h2>Why Is Space So Dark?</h2>
</div>
<div class="whyisspacedarkans">
    <p>Space is black because there is nothing there to reflect light. From space, Eath look lit up because light from our<br>Sun reflects off sea, and land, and the particles in our atmosphere.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="wheredoesspacebegingque">
    <h2>Where Does Space Begin?</h2>
</div>
<div class="wheredoesspacebegingans">
    <p>Earth is cloacked in a thin layer of gases - the atmosphere. Outside this atmosphereis space, where there is no<br>air to breathe, or to allow wings to fly, and where nobody can here you scream.</p>

<h2>Stargazers</h2>
</div>
<div class="stargazersans">
    <p>People have looked at the night sky for thousands of years. This study is called astronomy. Around 400 years ago,<br>a special tool was invented to make the task easier this tool is called a telescope.<br>Before the telescope people were shocked when Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus<br>suggested in 1543 that Earth was just another planet and the planet orbited (went around) the Sun. They had<br>believed Earth was at the centre of the universe.</p>
